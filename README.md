## Project Overview

This project leverages data from the Ministry of Tourism and Sports (MOTS) and the Bank of Thailand (BOT) to create an interactive Power BI dashboard that explores various aspects of Thailand's tourism landscape. The dashboard consists of six pages, each focusing on a specific area of analysis. 

**Data Sources:**

* Ministry of Tourism and Sports (MOTS): https://www.mots.go.th/news/category/411

**Project Structure:**

This repository contains the following:

* **Power BI File (`.pbix`):**  The interactive Power BI dashboard.
* **Subfolders:**  Code and data from related projects used to prepare the data for this Power BI analysis:
    * **`Get data from BOT API`:**  Python scripts for automating data acquisition from the BOT API.
    * **`Transform and Explore Data from MOTS`:**  Power Query and SQL scripts for transforming and cleaning data from MOTS.
* **`README.md`:**  This file.
